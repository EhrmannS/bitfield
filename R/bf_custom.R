#' @details In case you don't use a native function to build flags, the name
#'   should be of the form \code{activity_entity}, where 'activity' succinctly
#'   describes the function and 'entity' the object(s) or column(s) used by the
#'   function (if it's more than one object/column, they need to be concatenated
#'   with using a "_", as this is used internally to determine the provenance of
#'   the function). Both terms are from the
#'   \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/}{PROV Data Model}.
