# bitfield 0.2.0

* revise various functions
* improve text (readme/vignette)
* change naming of the functions
* correct terminology, the class is not the bitfield but instead an array or registry that contains information about the bitfield. Hence, I renamed it to `registry`.
* use attributes to capture a bitflag description and name.


# bitfield 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
